# image-ine
Programs for studying Image processing, manipulation, analysis and performing operations with, using OpenCV

## Why this project exists
I was presented with some questions on how to work with images and process them using OpenCV.  
The questions being:
1. [Arithmetic Operations](./1_ArithmeticAnalysis.py) on Images using 2 of them
2. [Convolution and Correlation](./2_ConvolutionCorrelation.py) of 2D images using 1 image and a filter
3. [Statistical Analysis](./3_StatisticalAnalysis.py) on images
4. [Point and Line Detection](./4_PointAndLine.py) in image using Laplacian and Hough methods
